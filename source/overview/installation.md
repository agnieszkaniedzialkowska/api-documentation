# Installation

Each API has its own plugin. Some of the APIs needs activation from Centra, such as the subscription API, but the other ones can be enabled easily by just adding a new plugin to your store.

To enable a plugin, go to `SYSTEM`, then select `STORES`. Select what store you want your API to connect to and select the API in the list of plugins. You will need administration rights to have access to `SYSTEM`.
