The Shop API makes it possible to connect to Centra by creating selections using an open cart. This selection is then possible to finalize into an order.

You can see more information about the specific calls in the [API Reference](/reference/old/shop-api/index). You can also see the API in the [Swagger UI for Shop API v1](https://docs.centra.com/swagger-ui/?api=ShopAPI).
