This chapter is still under construction. When finished, it will cover a comprehensive guide for creating a FE integration with Centra, the usage of Checkout API, details about available payment providers and methods, and a number of smaller guides about implementing CheckoutScript or selling Gift Certificates in your front end, plus a pre-launch check-list to help you get started. Ping us directly if you're interested in any of those topics, and we can advise even before the premiere.

Happy coding!
