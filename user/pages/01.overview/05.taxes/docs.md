There are three main concepts that govern how the Tax is applied in Centra: Tax Groups, Tax Rules and Tax Classes.

### Tax Groups

Tax Group consists of one or more Tax Rules, which control what amount of tax should be applied. You can configure any number of Tax Groups in Centra, but each Store can have only one default Tax Group. This will be the default Tax Group that is selected in Product Attributes configured for this store, but you can select any other Tax Group on a per-product basis, if necessary.

### Tax Rules

Tax Rules control what amount of tax should be applied based on Country and Customer or Account Tax Classes. For example, Tax Rule "VAT" can consist of three rules: EU, with 25% tax, Australia, with 10% tax, and Japan, with 8% tax.

For each Tax Rule you can also configure if the prices in your Store should be displayed with or without tax and whether or not to apply tax to the handling and shipping fees. Finally, for countries in which tax amount depends on the state (like US, Canada or Australia), you can select to apply tax per ship-to country *and* state, in which case you will need to create separate Rules for each of the tax rates and apply them to appropriate states.
