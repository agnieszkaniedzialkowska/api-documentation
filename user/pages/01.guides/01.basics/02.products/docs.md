Centra uses a predefined product model that is optimized to solve the complexities of fashion and lifestyle products. The structure cannot be changed by users, however users can switch some functionalities on and off and define their own attributes.

Two different concepts for modelling and storing items for sale are used in Centra: Displays and Products. This includes Variants and Sizes of Products.

### Displays

A Display is, just like a display in a brick-and-mortar store, one or more related items for sale that is arranged and presented in a way that might trigger a purchase. An item for sale might be included in more than one Display. You might for example have a unisex item included both in a Display in the Women’s and Men’s department. When you query the API for what to show on a category page, you will get a set of Displays back, and when you query the API for what to show on a product page, you will get a single Display.

### Products, Variants and Sizes

A Product is stored in a hierarchical structure, in which the Product is broken down into Variants and Sizes. The Product represents a certain design. Variants are different versions of the same product, typically different colors. Sizes are the different sizes you can buy the style in. This product structure enables very efficient product information management.

Most information is stored on the Product level, where you find the Folder, Collection and all basic information such as Country of Origin, HS Code and Material Composition.

The Variant level focuses on media (images) and a few attributes, notably color. Campaigns can be set on the Variant level. Besides actual size, the Size level stores GTINs (UPC or EAN codes), weight and dimensions. Stock inventory is stored on the Size level, as the size represents the physical item that exists in a warehouse.

All products have at least one Variant and all Variants have at least one Size, even if it is a one-size product.

### Attributes

Displays carry attributes set on all three different levels in the Product model as well as attributes set on the Display itself.

Centra has three Attribute Categories: Standard, Pre-Defined and Custom.


| Attribute Category | Description | Examples |
|--------------------|-------------|----------|
| Standard | Default attributes, not possible for user to disable | Display Name (Display), GTIN (Item), HS Code (Product) |
| Pre-defined | Pre-configured attributes, possible for user to turn on or off | Age limit (Product), Color (Variant), Length/Width/Depth (Item) |
| Custom | Custom attributes, defined by user | N/A (user defined) |

(Here comes a looong table explaining a lot of pre-defined attributes, I'm not so sure I want to copy it all here...)

### Relations

Displays can be related to each other in 3 different ways. All Display relationships are one-way, a two-way mutual relationship between 2 displays are created by 2 one-way relationships in opposite directions.

| Relationship | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| Variant | The related Display represents a different Variant of the Same Product (e.g. a different color of the same style. The linked Variant could also come from a different Product, e.g., if the Variant is made out of a different material. The expected frontend behavior is to provide a link to the related Variant, typically using a color or pattern swatch. |
| Size | The related Display represents a different Product in a different Size, following a different business logic than the fashion business logic built into Centra. E.g., a bag in a different size or a cosmetic product in a different size. The expected frontend behavior is to provide a link to the related Size, typically under a “different sizes” heading. |
| Standard | The related Display represents a related Product. The expected frontend behavior is to provide a link to the related Display, typically under a heading such as “Related products”. |

It is possible to configure custom types of relationships between Displays.

### Bundles

Bundles are available in both the Direct-To-Consumer and Wholesale modules of Centra, and work in the same way.

A bundle is a collection of 2 or more separate items sold together as a package. In the warehouse, the items exist as separate items, but in the store they are sold together, i.e., the customer adds them to the cart as one item and pays a price for the bundle rather than for individual products.

The price of a bundle can be generated by Centra as the sum of the price of the bundle’s components, referred to as Dynamic, or Fixed, which refers to a price that is set by the administrator. Regardless of how the price was set, it comes out of the Store API in the same way.

Centra handles 2 types of bundles: implicit bundles and explicit bundles.

#### Explicit bundles

The most general bundle case in Centra is the Explicit Bundle. An explicit bundle is defined by:
How many items should be included in the bundle (the number of slots)
Which Products should occupy each slot in the bundle (the same Product may be included multiple times, in multiple slots)
For each slot, which Variants and Sizes the customer should be allowed to select

An Explicit Bundle Display appears through the API very similarly to a normal Display, with a few exceptions:
Before adding to cart, the user will have to select which variant and size to get, for multiple items
The frontend is expected to render a variant selector (e.g., drop-down) for each item when multiple variants are allowed and a size selector (e.g., size table) for each item when multiple sizes are allowed

Even if multiple products have the same size chart, the expected behavior is to allow the customer to select the size of each item in the bundle individually.
If all products in the bundle share the same size chart, the bundle can be configured to only display one size chart, in which case it will become an implicit bundle.

Once added to cart, the Explicit Bundle should be shown as one line, with one price.

#### Implicit bundles

An implicit bundle is the special case when, for each Product in the bundle, there is only one variant and one size allowed
OR there is only one variant allowed and all products share the same size chart and Centra has been configured to only offer one size selection for all items in the bundle. The bundle will not appear to the customer as a bundle, but as a normal product (hence being implicit).

As with explicit bundles, once added to cart, the Explicit Bundle should be shown as one line, with one price.

#### Pre-packs

A pre-pack refers to a set of items packaged together and sold as one item. A pre-pack is stored in the warehouse as one pickable item. It is therefore neither an implicit nor an explicit bundle and should be set up in Centra as a normal product and will appear through the Store API as a normal product. The attribute multipack should be used if the pre-pack only contains identical items.

#### Buy X, pay for Y

A discount logic that allows a customer to buy a number of products (with certain restrictions) but pay for fewer (e.g., buy 3, pay for 2) is not a bundle, it is a Voucher.

### Categories and Folders

Centra handles the similar concepts, Category and Folder, differently. A Display belongs to a Category. Categories are hierarchical in up to 3 levels. The expected behavior of a Centra store frontend is to allow the user to navigate the Category tree to discover products. The Category structure can be expected to change dynamically. It is safe to assume there will never be more than 3 category levels, but there are no limitations when it comes to the number of categories.

A Product belongs to one and only one Folder. Folders are used for reporting and should not be exposed on the frontend site. As Categories, Folders are also hierarchical with up to 3 levels. Even though Folders are not expected to be exposed on the website, they are available through the Store API to facilitate development of custom applications.
