Each API has its own plugin. Some of the APIs need activation from Centra, such as the subscription API, but the other ones can be easily enabled by adding a new plugin to your store.

To enable a plugin, go to `SYSTEM`, then select `STORES`. Select what store you want your API to connect to and select the API in the list of plugins. You will need administration rights to have access to `SYSTEM`.
